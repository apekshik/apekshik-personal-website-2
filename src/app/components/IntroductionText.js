      <p>Hi, I'm Apek!<br/> Although I'm currently a Founding Platform Engineer at Euso AI,
        I also LOVE solving
        tough physics problems, playing the drums, and designing and coding websites like this.
        A harmful side effect of having so many hobbies is I love talking to people and learning about their experiences and interests. 
        <br/> So, feel free to reach out to me!</p>
